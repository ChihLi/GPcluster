# GPcluster
This R package allows the estimation and prediction for a clustered Gaussian process model, which can deal with the nonstationarity issue and computational issue for a standard Gaussian process model. The estimation methods for the unknown parameters are based on a stochastic EM algorithm. More details can be seen in Sung et al (2019) <arXiv:1911.04602>.
